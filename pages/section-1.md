# Evolution of Infrastructure & Systems

<div class="opacity-80 italic mb-4">
Two parallel revolutions that shaped modern computing
</div>

<!--
# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- Frame history as context for modern tools
- Set expectation for parallel stories
- Connect to their development experience

Key Points:
- Two revolutions happened together
- Each drove the other forward
- Still evolving today

Questions/Engagement:
- "What infrastructure changes have you seen?"
- "How has development changed with it?"

Next:
- Let's look at infrastructure changes first

    title Infrastructure Management Journey
    section 2000s
        Physical Era : Manual Operations
        : Datacenter Hardware
        : Weeks to Deploy
    section Late 2000s
        Virtualization : VMware & Hypervisors
        : Template-based
        : Days to Deploy
    section Early 2010s
        Cloud Era : API-driven Resources
        : On-demand Scaling
        : Minutes to Deploy
    section Late 2010s
        IaC Era : Code-defined
        : Version Controlled
        : Seconds to Deploy
```
<!--
# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- Visualize the transformation scale
- Focus on speed of change
- Note accelerating pace

Key Points:
- Each jump brought 10x improvement
- Changed how we think about servers
- Automation became essential

Questions/Engagement:
- "When did you start working with cloud?"
- "Which era's tools do you use?"

# Infrastructure Evolution Metrics
Quantifying the impact of infrastructure transformation

<table class="metrics-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Era</th>
      <th>Time to Provision</th>
      <th>Servers per Admin</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr v-click="1">
      <td>Physical</td>
      <td>Weeks</td>
      <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr v-click="2">
      <td>Virtual</td>
      <td>Days</td>
      <td>100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr v-click="3">
      <td>Cloud</td>
      <td>Minutes</td>
      <td>500</td>
    </tr>
    <tr v-click="4">
      <td>IaC</td>
      <td>Seconds</td>
      <td>1000+</td>
    </tr>

}
.metrics-table td {

}
</style>

<!--
# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- These metrics don't show real impact, mostly ilustrate to idea
- Focus on two key metrics

Key Points:
- Deployment time: 10000x faster
- Admin capacity: 100x increase
- Every step multiplied capability

Questions/Engagement:
- "What enabled each jump?"
- "Which metric matters more?"

Next:
- Look at what drove these changes

# Systems Architecture Evolution
How software systems grew in complexity and scale

```mermaid
timeline
    title Software Systems Evolution
    section Early 2000s
        Monolithic : Single Application
        : One Database
        : Simple Deploy
    section Mid 2000s
        Service-Oriented : Multiple Services
        : Multiple Databases
        : Coordinated Deploy
    section 2010s
        Cloud Native : Microservices
        : Distributed Data
        : Container Deploy
        : Kubernetes
    section 2020s
        Modern : Serverless & Containers
        : Many services, many databases
        : Multi-cloud
        : Continuous Deployments
```

<!--
# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- Connect to their software experience
- System architecture drove infrastructure
- Still happening today

Key Points:
- Monolith: Simple but limiting
- Services: Team independence
- Cloud Native: Infrastructure complexity
- Modern: Mix of approaches

Questions/Engagement:
- "Have you worked on any team projects?"
- "Which architectures have you worked with?"
- "What drove your architecture choices?"

# Key System Characteristics

<v-clicks>

- Monolithic: One team, one deploy, one database
- Service-Oriented: Multiple teams, coordinated deploys
- Cloud Native: Many small services, continuous deployment
- Modern: Mix of serverless, containers, and cloud services

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-12 text-center text-xl">

💡 More Components = More Infrastructure Complexity

</div>

<!--
# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- Each stage brought new challenges
- Progress wasn't always smooth
- Different teams moved at different speeds

Expand on each point:
- Monolithic: Like your early one person projects - simple stack
- SOA: Teams start interfering with each other, need coordination
- Cloud Native: Kubernetes entered the scene and more complex automated orchestration becomes accesible
- Modern: Mix of approaches based on needs

Key message: Infrastructure complexity follows system complexity - this is why we need better tools and practices.

Question to ask: "What architectures have you seen and worked with?"

# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- Fundamental mindset shift
- Changed how we manage servers
- Still relevant today

Key message: Fundamental shift in how we think about servers

Additional context to mention:
- Pets: We care for them individually, nurse them back to health
- Cattle: Replaceable, automated management
- Like your laptop (pet) vs a Docker container (cattle)
- This mindset shift enabled modern cloud scaling

Questions/Engagement:
- "Where do you see each approach?"
- "Which fits cloud better?"-->
