# The Evolution Steps
From raw resources to developer experience

::left::

## Raw Pulumi
```csharp
// Direct Azure resource creation
var database = new Database(
    name: resourceName,
    args: new DatabaseArgs
    {
        ResourceGroupName = resourceGroup.Name,
        ServerName = server.Name,
        Location = location.Id,
        Sku = new SkuArgs
        {
            Name = "Standard",
            Tier = "Standard",
            Capacity = db.Dtu
        }
    },
    options: new CustomResourceOptions
    {
        Protect = protectFromDeletion
    }
);
```

::right::

## Low-Level SDK
```csharp
// Wrapped with better defaults
var database = AzureSqlDatabase.Create(
    resourceName: resourceName,
    databaseName: databaseName,
    resourceGroup: resourceGroup,
    location: location,
    server: server,
    tier: new StandardDb(50),
    readScaleOut: DatabaseReadScale.Enabled,
    zoneRedundant: true,
    protectFromDeletion: true
);
```

<!--
# Speaker Notes

Setup:
- "Let's see real examples from our codebase..."

Evolution Steps:
1. Raw Pulumi
   - Direct resource creation
   - All options explicit
   - Complex configuration
   - Error-prone

2. Low-Level SDK
   - Better parameter organization
   - Sensible defaults
   - Type safety
   - Still infrastructure-focused

Key Improvements:
- Reduced complexity
- Better error handling
- Standardized options
- Clearer intentions

Show in IDE:
- Parameter completion
- Type checking
- Documentation

# High-Level SDK Today

```csharp
// From real Mews Infrastructure.cs
var database = builder.AddSqlDatabase(new SqlDatabaseArgs(
    Server: new SqlServerArgs(
        Location: location,
        AdminLogin: builder.GetString("sql-server-admin-login"),
        AdminPassword: new OutputValueSource(builder.GetSecret("sql-server-admin-password"))
    ),
    Name: "main",
    Tier: new Hyperscale(CpuCount: 2),
    ZoneRedundancy: false,
    HighAvailabilityReplicaCount: 0,
    BackupStorageRedundancy: BackupStorageRedundancy.Local,
    GeoReplicaInPairedRegion: false
));

// Inject configurations into container app
app.InjectKeyVaultURI(keyVault);
app.InjectSqlConnectionStrings(database);
app.InjectAppConfigurationEndpoint(appConfiguration);
app.InjectRedisConnectionInfo(cache, new RedisOptions());
```
